Bitcoin mining has always promised outsized returns — and delivered outsized complexity. You needed capital for hardware, space for rigs, cheap electricity deals, and the technical know-how to keep it all running. For most individual investors, it was simply off the table.

GoMining changes that. It's one of the more interesting DeFi infrastructure plays I've come across: a platform that lets you own a share of real Bitcoin mining hashpower through NFT-based digital miners, without touching a single piece of hardware.

Here's how it works, what the numbers look like, and whether it makes sense as part of a passive income portfolio.

## What Is GoMining?

GoMining is a Bitcoin cloud mining platform built around **Digital Miners** — NFT assets that represent real hashpower in GoMining's licensed data centres across the US, Africa, and Central Asia. When you buy a Digital Miner, you're buying a fractional share of actual ASIC mining rigs. GoMining handles everything operational: hardware procurement, facility maintenance, cooling, and electricity.

Your miner earns Bitcoin daily, automatically, paid directly to your wallet.

The platform runs on multiple blockchains (Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, TON), has a native utility token ($GOMINING), and layers a competitive game mode called **Miner Wars** on top of the core product.

## How the Economics Work

Each Digital Miner is defined by two variables: **hashpower (TH/s)** and **energy efficiency**. GoMining offers 20 power levels, ranging from 1 TH/s up to 5,000 TH/s. Entry-level miners start around $25.

Your daily BTC payout is calculated like this:

**Daily reward = Pool payout based on your TH/s − Maintenance fee**

The maintenance fee covers electricity and equipment service — currently around **$0.0089 per TH/s per day**, billed in BTC at the daily rate. More efficient miners carry lower fees relative to their output, which is where the real edge comes from as you scale up.

As a concrete reference point: a 10 TH/s miner earns roughly **0.0000041 BTC per day** from pool rewards before fees. Small individually, but it compounds — and you can hold as many miners as you want.

You can receive payouts in BTC, USDT, TON, or GOMINING tokens, and withdrawals carry zero fees.

## The GOMINING Token: More Than Just a Governance Token

A lot of DeFi utility tokens are dressed-up governance props. GOMINING is more tightly integrated than most.

**Practical uses within the platform:**

- **Maintenance discounts** — pay your daily fees in GOMINING and get up to **20% off**, which meaningfully improves net yield
- **Miner acquisition and upgrades** — use tokens to buy or level up your Digital Miners
- **Miner Wars boosts** — in-game currency for the competitive mining game mode
- **Governance / staking** — lock GOMINING for 1 week to 4 years to earn veGOMINING voting power; every Tuesday, 20% of newly minted tokens distribute to veGOMINING holders proportional to their stake

The longer you lock, the more votes — and the more of the weekly token distribution — you receive. It's a veTokenomics model similar to Curve's, applied to a mining context.

## The Infrastructure Behind It

This is what separates GoMining from the many cloud mining scams that have come and gone: **verifiable physical infrastructure**.

GoMining operates **9 mining farms** globally, with access to wholesale electricity pricing. Their facilities are licensed data centres, and the hashpower backing each NFT is auditable. The company has also made noise about renewable energy sourcing — important both for ESG optics and for managing long-term electricity cost competitiveness.

Planned 2025 additions include:
- A **GoMining Payment Card** (Q4 2025) to spend BTC rewards directly via virtual/physical card
- **DeFi collateralisation** — use your NFT miners as collateral for loans or staking positions

The roadmap suggests a platform thinking beyond simple cloud mining and toward a fuller DeFi primitive.

## Miner Wars: The Gamified Layer

If you want more than passive accumulation, Miner Wars turns mining into a competitive clan-based game. Teams battle for weekly prize pools in BTC and GOMINING tokens. It's optional — your base miner keeps earning regardless — but it adds a social and competitive dimension that makes the platform stickier than a typical cloud mining dashboard.

## What to Watch Out For

No honest review skips the risks.

**Bitcoin price dependency** — your daily BTC earnings are worth more when BTC is up and less when it's down. ROI projections always assume some price appreciation; model conservative scenarios too.

**Maintenance fees are variable** — they're pegged to operational costs. If electricity prices spike globally, fees can move. Check the current rate before buying.

**Token concentration** — the GOMINING token's governance rewards are more meaningful at scale. Small holders see limited benefit from the veTokenomics layer.

**Cloud mining trust** — the category has a poor historical reputation. GoMining's physical infrastructure and track record (Trustpilot average above 4.5 stars) put it in a different tier, but do your own diligence before committing significant capital.

---

## How It Fits Into a Passive Income Portfolio

For a Flolio-style investor — someone tracking dividends, staking rewards, and yield across multiple assets — GoMining slots in as a **BTC-denominated yield position**. Instead of holding idle BTC, your capital generates daily mining rewards. It's not staking (you're not validating a network), but the income profile is similar: predictable daily payouts, compoundable by reinvesting into more miners.

The correlation to BTC price is direct, which is either a feature or a risk depending on your book. If you're already long BTC and looking for yield on that exposure, GoMining is one of the cleaner ways to access it.

## Getting Started

1. **Sign up** via app (iOS / Android) or web — supports Google, Apple, or Web3 wallet login
2. **Buy your first Digital Miner** — entry level starts around $25; scale from there
3. **Collect daily BTC** — payouts are automatic, withdrawals are free
4. **Optimise** — pay fees in GOMINING tokens for the maintenance discount; stake GOMINING for weekly token rewards
