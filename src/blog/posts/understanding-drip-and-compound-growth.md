## What Is DRIP?

A **Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP)** is a mechanism — either through your broker or directly with a company — that automatically uses your dividend payments to purchase additional shares of the same stock or fund.

Instead of receiving €80 in cash from a dividend payment, you receive approximately 0.4 additional shares of a €200 stock (minus any fees). Over years and decades, this automatic reinvestment creates an accelerating cycle of income growth.

The mechanic is simple. The math is surprisingly powerful.

## The Math Behind Compound Dividend Growth

Consider a basic example:

- Initial investment: **€10,000**
- Dividend yield: **4% per year**
- Dividend growth rate: **5% per year** (company raises its dividend annually)
- No additional contributions

Without DRIP (cash dividends, spent):

After 20 years, you still own €10,000 worth of shares (ignoring price appreciation), plus you've received €4,000/year (growing) in cash. Total dividends collected: roughly €132,000 over 20 years.

With DRIP (all dividends reinvested):

After 20 years, your total portfolio value grows to approximately **€26,500** — and your annual dividend income has grown to roughly **€1,100/year**, even without a single additional deposit.

The difference? €10,000 generating €1,100/year passively. That's the DRIP effect.

## Why Dividend Growth Rate Matters More Than Yield

New investors often chase the highest yield they can find. This is a mistake.

A stock yielding 8% that cuts its dividend in two years is worth far less than a stock yielding 3% that raises its dividend by 7% annually.

Here's why:

If you invest €10,000 in a 3% yielder that grows its dividend at 7% per year, your **yield on cost** (dividend income divided by your original investment) after 15 years is:

```
3% × (1.07)^15 ≈ 8.3% yield on cost
```

You're now effectively earning 8.3% annually on your original €10,000 — from a stock that *started* at 3%.

This is why experienced dividend investors talk about "yield on cost" rather than current yield. Time and growth rate are the variables that matter most.

## DRIP vs. Manual Reinvestment

There are two ways to reinvest dividends:

**Automatic DRIP** — your broker automatically buys fractional shares on the ex-dividend date. No action required. Most efficient, no cash drag.

**Manual reinvestment** — dividends accumulate as cash, and you manually buy shares when you choose. Allows you to redirect income toward whichever position is most undervalued at that moment.

For most investors with diversified portfolios, automatic DRIP is the better default. Attempting to time purchases and allocate manually across multiple positions requires constant attention and often leads to worse outcomes.

## Modeling Your DRIP Future

The formula for projecting your future income with DRIP is a variant of the dividend growth model:

```
Future Annual Income = P × Y × (1 + g)^t
```

Where:
- **P** = current portfolio value
- **Y** = current yield
- **g** = expected annual dividend growth rate
- **t** = number of years

But this formula understates the true result because it doesn't account for share price appreciation (which increases the absolute dividend even at a fixed yield) or for the additional shares being purchased each year.

A more accurate projection requires modeling the compounding effect year-by-year, which is why a DRIP simulator is valuable. You enter your current holdings, each position's yield and growth rate, and the simulator shows you what your monthly income looks like in 5, 10, or 20 years.

## The Impact of Dividend Growth Rate: A Sensitivity Table

Here's how different growth rates change your outcome on a €10,000, 4% yield portfolio over 20 years (DRIP on, no additional contributions):

| Dividend Growth Rate | Year 10 Annual Income | Year 20 Annual Income |
|---------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| 0% (flat)           | €400                 | €400                 |
| 3%                  | €537                 | €722                 |
| 5%                  | €651                 | €1,033               |
| 7%                  | €787                 | €1,485               |
| 10%                 | €1,036               | €2,764               |

The difference between a 3% and 7% grower is **€763/year** after 20 years — from the same €10,000 starting investment.

## Sector Considerations for DRIP Investors

Not all sectors are equally suited to DRIP investing:

**Best for DRIP:**
- Consumer staples and utilities — slow but highly reliable dividend growth
- Healthcare — aging demographics drive consistent earnings
- Dividend ETFs — instant diversification with automatic reinvestment

**Use with caution:**
- High-yield REITs — yields are attractive, but REIT dividends are taxed as ordinary income in many jurisdictions, reducing the effective compounding rate
- Resources and commodities — dividends are often variable, tied to commodity prices
- Very high-yield stocks — yields above 8% often signal underlying stress; dividend cuts destroy the compounding thesis

## Tax Considerations

DRIP is not free from taxes in most jurisdictions. In many countries, dividends are taxed **when received**, even if reinvested immediately. This means:

1. You receive a €100 dividend
2. Tax authorities consider this €100 of income (taxable at your dividend rate)
3. Your broker reinvests the after-tax amount (e.g., €73 if your effective rate is 27%)

This is why holding dividend stocks in a tax-advantaged account (like a UK ISA, German depot, or US 401k/IRA) supercharges DRIP — the full dividend gets reinvested without the tax drag.

If you're investing in a taxable account, factor in your dividend tax rate when projecting future income.

## Tracking DRIP Progress Over Time

The challenge with DRIP is that it's silent. Reinvestment happens automatically in the background, shares accumulate slowly, and it's easy to lose sight of the compounding that's taking place.

To stay motivated:

- Track your **shares owned** over time — watching this number grow confirms that the mechanism is working
- Track your **trailing 12-month dividend income** — this is the clearest signal of progress
- Compare your **yield on cost** each year — a rising yield on cost confirms dividend growth is compounding

Flolio's income tracker shows you trailing 12-month income across all connected brokers, and the dividend calendar gives you visibility into exactly when each payment arrives. You can see the DRIP accumulating in real time rather than waiting for year-end statements.

## Conclusion

DRIP is not exciting. It doesn't make headlines. But over 15–20 years, the combination of automatic reinvestment and consistent dividend growth creates income that compounds quietly in the background — turning a modest starting investment into a machine that pays you more each year, without any additional effort.

The best time to start was 10 years ago. The second best time is now.
