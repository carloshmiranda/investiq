# InvestIQ Progress Tracker

## CRITICAL: READ THIS FIRST, EVERY SESSION

Before writing a single line of code:

1. Read PROGRESS.md to understand what is done and what is next
2. Read MVP.md to remember the final goal
3. Find the FIRST UNCHECKED item in the backlog
4. Execute it fully
5. Commit, push, update PROGRESS.md
6. WITHOUT STOPPING — move to the next unchecked item
7. Repeat until context is 90-95% full, all items done, or a blocker is hit

## Autonomous Execution Contract

**Rule 1 — Keep going until context is full**
Complete backlog items sequentially without stopping between them.
After each item: commit, push, update PROGRESS.md, then immediately
start the next unchecked item. Only stop when ONE of these is true:
  a) All backlog items are complete (MVP reached)
  b) You estimate your context window is 90-95% full — finish the
     current item cleanly, commit, push, write "STOPPING: context near
     limit" in PROGRESS.md session log, then exit
  c) A MANUAL STEP REQUIRED browser action is needed — print
     instructions and stop
  d) BLOCKED after 3 failed fix attempts — document and stop

Never stop just because an item is done. Always look at the next one.

## ENDING A SESSION (Claude Code does this autonomously)

After EACH completed item:
```
git add .
git commit -m "feat: [item id] [description]"
git push
# update PROGRESS.md item to ✅ and add session log row
git add PROGRESS.md
git commit -m "chore: update progress tracker"
git push
# immediately start next item — do NOT stop
```

On final stop (context limit / blocker / manual step / MVP complete):
```
# Add to PROGRESS.md session log:
# "STOPPING: [reason] — resume with ./run.sh"
git add PROGRESS.md
git commit -m "chore: session end - [reason]"
git push
```

## Status
🟢 MVP COMPLETE
Architecture: Vercel Serverless Functions (/api) + Neon PostgreSQL via Vercel Marketplace (single repo)
Currency: USD/EUR/GBP switcher. Rates from open.exchangerate-api.com (free, no key).
Cached 1hr server-side. User preference stored in DB. Context-driven, zero page reloads.

## Live URLs
- Frontend: https://investiq-nine.vercel.app
- API: served from Vercel Serverless Functions under /api
- Database: Neon PostgreSQL via Vercel Marketplace (managed at vercel.com/storage)

## GitHub Repo
https://github.com/carloshmiranda/investiq

## Database
- Provider: Neon PostgreSQL (free tier, scales to zero, never pauses)
- Installed via Vercel Marketplace — managed from vercel.com/storage
- Connection strings: injected automatically as DATABASE_URL + DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED (never in git)
- User currency preference stored in users table as a currencyCode field (default: 'USD')

## Completed ✅
- [x] 0.1 — Monorepo restructured (client/ + server/), Express server scaffolded,
        Prisma schema created. **Superseded by architecture migration to Vercel Serverless + Supabase.**

## Backlog (in order — keep going until context is full)

### Foundation & Infrastructure
- [x] 0.1 — Create GitHub repo (single repo, not monorepo), init Vite + React + TailwindCSS,
            add /api folder with a health check function (GET /api/health returns {ok:true}),
            push to GitHub, connect to Vercel, confirm both frontend and /api/health are live

- [x] 0.2 — Install Neon via Vercel Marketplace, pull env vars with `vercel env pull .env`,
            set up Prisma schema (users, connections, portfolio_cache, sessions),
            run first migration against Neon DB, confirm Prisma can query from a test
            /api/db-check serverless function then delete it

- [x] 0.3 — Client: add /login and /register routes to React Router,
        protected route wrapper, auth context skeleton

- [x] 0.4 — Add currencyCode field (String, default 'USD') to User model in Prisma schema,
            run migration, update all auth endpoints to return currencyCode in user payload

- [x] 0.5 — Create /lib/exchangeRates.js on the server: fetch USD base rates from
            https://open.exchangerate-api.com/v6/latest/USD, cache result in module-level
            variable with 1hr TTL, export getRate(toCurrency) helper.
            Create GET /api/rates endpoint returning { USD: 1, EUR: x, GBP: x, updatedAt }.
            Create PATCH /api/user/currency endpoint (body: { currencyCode }) that validates
            input is one of ['USD','EUR','GBP'], updates users table, returns updated user.

### Auth System
- [x] 1.1 — POST /api/auth/register (bcrypt hash, create user, return JWT pair)
- [x] 1.2 — POST /api/auth/login (verify password, return access + refresh tokens),
        POST /api/auth/refresh, POST /api/auth/logout
- [x] 1.3 — JWT middleware (verify access token on all protected routes, attach userId)
- [x] 1.4 — Client: /register page (name, email, password, confirm password)
- [x] 1.5 — Client: /login page, JWT storage in memory + refresh token cookie
- [x] 1.6 — Client: auth context (useAuth hook), protected route redirect, silent token refresh
- [x] 1.7 — Client: /settings page (change name, email, password, active sessions, logout all)

### Mock Data & Core UI
- [x] 2.1 — Migrate existing mock data + all 6 pages into src/ structure

- [x] 2.2 — Create CurrencyContext (/src/context/CurrencyContext.jsx):
            loads rates from GET /api/rates on mount, refreshes every hour,
            stores { activeCurrency, setActiveCurrency, convert(amount), formatMoney(amount) }.
            convert(amount) multiplies by the active rate.
            formatMoney(amount) returns Intl.NumberFormat string with correct symbol and locale
            (en-US/USD, de-DE/EUR, en-GB/GBP).
            Persist activeCurrency to localStorage and sync with user's currencyCode in DB
            via PATCH /api/user/currency on every switch.
            Wrap App.jsx with <CurrencyProvider> inside <AuthProvider>.

- [x] 2.3 — Add currency switcher UI to Header component:
            A compact 3-button toggle (USD | EUR | GBP) in the top-right of the header,
            next to the user avatar/settings link.
            Active currency highlighted with the emerald accent (#10b981).
            Clicking switches instantly via setActiveCurrency from CurrencyContext.
            No page reload required — all values re-render reactively.

- [x] 2.4 — Dashboard KPI cards, income sparkline, health score wired to mock data
- [x] 2.5 — Holdings table, Income page charts, Calendar grid wired to mock data

### DeGiro Integration (serverless, authenticated per user)
- [x] 7.1 — DeGiro auth service (migrate from old edge functions to /api/brokers/degiro/)
- [x] 7.2 — DeGiro portfolio + products fetch, store session encrypted in DB
- [x] 7.3 — DeGiro dividends fetch, mapped to income events
- [x] 7.4 — Client: DeGiro connect modal calls new serverless endpoints (auth required)

### Trading 212 Integration
- [x] 8.1 — Trading 212 client (API key auth, rate limiter)
- [x] 8.2 — T212 portfolio + dividend history fetch + mapper
- [x] 8.3 — Store T212 API key encrypted in DB per user
- [x] 8.4 — Client: T212 connect modal

### Binance Integration

- [x] 11.3 — Portfolio cache layer (TTL 1hr, invalidate on manual sync)

### AI Insights
- [x] 12.1 — Client: chat UI + suggested prompts
- [x] 12.2 — POST /api/ai/chat — Claude claude-sonnet-4-6, portfolio context injected

### Polish
- [x] 13.1 — Loading skeletons, error boundaries, empty states
- [x] 13.2 — Responsive audit, production smoke test

### UI Design Polish — Priority 1 (high impact, low effort)
- [x] 14.1 — Background atmosphere (global): radial gradient on body (`src/index.css`), optional CSS noise overlay
- [x] 14.2 — Staggered card-reveal animations: apply `.card-reveal` to Dashboard, Income, Holdings, Calendar, AIInsights

## Session Log
| Date | Item | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| 2026-02-19 | 0.1 | Monorepo restructure: client/ + server/ scaffold. Vercel root dir needs manual update to `client/`. Railway setup needed for server/. |
| 2026-02-19 | Architecture migration | Replaced Railway+Express with Vercel Serverless Functions + Supabase. Folder structure flattened to single repo. vercel.json updated. |
| 2026-02-19 | Fix: Vercel function limit | Consolidated 14 → 7 serverless functions to stay within Hobby plan (12 max). auth/[action].js, connections/[provider].js, brokers/[...path].js. |
| 2026-02-19 | 0.1 | GitHub repo live, Vite+React+Tailwind built, /api/health returns {ok:true} in production. Frontend live at https://investiq-nine.vercel.app. |
| 2026-02-19 | 0.2 | Neon DB set up via Vercel Marketplace. Prisma schema migrated. 4 tables created: users, connections, portfolio_cache, sessions. DATABASE_URL injected automatically by Vercel. /api/db-check confirmed {ok:true,userCount:0} then deleted. |
| 2026-02-19 | 0.3 | AuthContext (login/register/logout, in-memory token), ProtectedRoute, Login and Register pages. All protected routes redirect to /login when unauthenticated. |
| 2026-02-19 | 1.1 | POST /api/auth/register live. bcrypt hash, Neon insert, jose JWT pair, httpOnly refresh cookie. Fixed vercel.json — removed /api rewrite that blocked serverless functions. |
| 2026-02-19 | 1.2 | POST /api/auth/login + refresh + logout live. Refresh token rotation (jti+iat prevents same-second collision). Replay of rotated/logged-out tokens correctly rejected. |
| 2026-02-19 | 1.3 | createProtectedHandler added to apiHandler.js. All non-auth routes now return 401 without Bearer token, 401 with invalid token, pass through to handler with valid token. |
| 2026-02-19 | 1.4 | Register.jsx upgraded: confirm password field, client-side validation (required fields, email format, min 8 chars, passwords match). API errors still surfaced from AuthContext. |
| 2026-02-19 | 1.5 | Login.jsx: client-side validation (required fields). AuthContext: withCredentials:true on all auth axios calls so httpOnly refresh cookie is sent. Created run.sh (vercel dev). |
| 2026-02-19 | 1.6 | AuthContext: isLoading starts true, useEffect on mount calls /api/auth/refresh to restore session. authAxios instance with request interceptor (Bearer token) + response interceptor (401→refresh+retry, on refresh failure clears auth). ProtectedRoute spins while isLoading, then redirects. |
| 2026-02-20 | 1.7 | Settings page: profile edit (name/email), password change (current+new+confirm), active sessions list with revoke/logout-all. Sidebar updated with Settings nav item + real user name/initials + sign-out button. AuthContext gained updateUser(). Backend API already existed at api/user/[action].js. |
| 2026-02-20 | 2.1 | All 6 pages already in src/pages/ (Dashboard, Income, Holdings, Calendar, Connections, AIInsights) with full Recharts integration. Mock data layer (mockPortfolio.js) provides stocks, crypto, income history, projections, upcoming payments, connections + computed helpers. All routes wired in App.jsx with ProtectedRoute + Layout. Build passes clean. |
| 2026-02-20 | Scope update | Added currency switcher feature (USD/EUR/GBP) to MVP. New backlog items: 0.4, 0.5, 2.2, 2.3. All downstream items renumbered. |
| 2026-02-20 | 0.4 | Added currencyCode (String, default 'USD') to User model. Migration applied to Neon DB. All auth endpoints (register, login, refresh) and user endpoints (profile GET/PUT) now return currencyCode in user payload. |
| 2026-02-20 | 0.5 | Exchange rate service: /lib/exchangeRates.js fetches USD-based rates from open.exchangerate-api.com, caches 1hr in module variable, exports getRate() and getAllRates(). GET /api/rates returns { USD, EUR, GBP, updatedAt }. PATCH /api/user/currency validates input against ['USD','EUR','GBP'], updates DB, returns user. Added PATCH to CORS allowed methods. |
| 2026-02-20 | 2.2 | CurrencyContext created: loads rates from GET /api/rates on mount, refreshes every hour, provides activeCurrency/setActiveCurrency/convert(amount)/formatMoney(amount). Syncs user preference from DB on login, persists to localStorage, patches DB on switch. App.jsx wrapped with CurrencyProvider inside AuthProvider. Build passes clean. |
| 2026-02-20 | 2.3 | Currency switcher added to Header: compact 3-button toggle ($ USD | € EUR | £ GBP) between income pill and date/time. Active currency highlighted with emerald accent. Clicking switches instantly via CurrencyContext — no reload. Header portfolio value and income pill now use formatMoney() for live currency conversion. Build passes clean. |
| 2026-02-20 | 2.4 | Dashboard fully wired to CurrencyContext: all 4 KPI cards (total value, annual income, monthly income, YTD received), income bar chart (6-month history with converted Y-axis and tooltips), sector allocation pie chart, upcoming payments, and top movers all use formatMoney/formatLocal/convert from useCurrency(). Added formatLocal() to CurrencyContext for formatting pre-converted amounts. Enhanced formatMoney() to accept decimals param. Cleaned up unused imports. Build passes clean. |
| 2026-02-20 | run.sh update | Multi-item sessions enabled. Context monitoring at 90%. Claude runs until near limit then stops and resumes next session. |
| 2026-02-20 | 2.5 | Holdings table, Income page (KPIs, timeline chart, forecast chart, DRIP simulator, breakdown bars), and Calendar (month total, day detail, sidebar, summary) all wired to CurrencyContext. Replaced all hardcoded USD formatCurrency calls with formatMoney/formatLocal/convert. Chart Y-axes and tooltips convert reactively. Build passes clean. |
| 2026-02-20 | 7.1-7.4 | DeGiro integration complete. Backend: /api/degiro/[action].js serverless function handles login, totp, portfolio, products, dividends, transactions — proxies to trader.degiro.nl with JSESSIONID extraction, config resolution, account info fetch. Frontend: degiro services (auth.js, portfolio.js) and DegiroContext updated to use authAxios from AuthContext for JWT-authenticated requests. Client connect modal already existed in Connections page. Build passes clean. |
| 2026-02-20 | 8.1-8.4 | Trading 212 integration complete. Backend: /api/trading212/[action].js — connect (validates API key against T212 account summary, stores AES-256-GCM encrypted key+secret in connections table), disconnect, status, positions, dividends (cursor-paginated), account. Frontend: Trading212Context (connect/sync/disconnect with auto-status-check on mount), services (api.js), mapper (mapPosition/mapDividend/mergeHoldings), Trading212Modal + Trading212Card in Connections page. CurrencyContext wired throughout. Build passes clean. |
| 2026-02-20 | 9.1-9.4 | Binance integration complete. Backend: /api/binance/[action].js — HMAC-SHA256 signed requests, connect (validates via /api/v3/account), disconnect, status, balances (spot), earn (flexible+locked Simple Earn), dividends (asset distributions + earn rewards), prices (ticker map for USD valuation). API key+secret stored AES-256-GCM encrypted. Frontend: BinanceContext (connect/sync/disconnect), services (api.js), mapper (spot balances, earn positions, dividends/rewards with price lookup), BinanceModal + BinanceCard in Connections page. Brand color #f0b90b. Build passes clean. |
| 2026-02-20 | 10.1-10.4 | Crypto.com integration complete. Backend: /api/cryptocom/[action].js — HMAC-SHA256 signed POST requests to Exchange v1 API. Connect (validates via private/user-balance), disconnect, status, balances (spot+staking from user-balance), history (get-trades), prices (public get-tickers for USD valuation). Key+secret stored AES-256-GCM encrypted. Frontend: CryptocomContext with price-enriched holdings+totalValue, services (api.js with getPrices), mapper (buildPriceMap, getUsdPrice, mapBalance, mapStakingPosition, mapTrade, mergeHoldings). CryptocomCard+CryptocomModal wired into Connections page grid. cryptocomConnected counted in liveSourceCount. Brand color #002d74/#1199fa. Build passes clean. |
| 2026-02-20 | 11.1 | GET /api/portfolio — unified portfolio endpoint. Fetches holdings from all connected providers (T212, Binance, Crypto.com) in parallel with decrypted credentials. Each provider's API called server-side. Holdings normalized to common shape with price/value. Returns merged array + totalValue + sources + errors. DeGiro excluded (session-based). Build passes clean. |
| 2026-02-20 | 11.2 | GET /api/income — unified income endpoint. Fetches dividend/reward events from T212 (paginated dividends), Binance (asset dividends + earn rewards), Crypto.com (trades). Events normalized, sorted by date desc. Returns events + totalIncome + sources + errors. Build passes clean. |
| 2026-02-20 | 11.3 | Portfolio cache layer: lib/cache.js with getCache/setCache/invalidateCache using portfolio_cache table (1hr TTL). Both /api/portfolio and /api/income check cache first, support ?refresh=true bypass. POST endpoints for cache invalidation. Cache only stored on error-free fetches. Build passes clean. |
| 2026-02-20 | 12.1 | Client AI chat UI wired to POST /api/ai/chat via authAxios. Removed mock responses. Chat UI: message bubbles, markdown rendering, typing indicator, suggested prompts (6), insight cards (3). Removed news feed section. Build passes clean. |
| 2026-02-20 | 12.2 | POST /api/ai/chat: calls Anthropic Messages API with claude-sonnet-4-6. Portfolio+income data from cache injected into system prompt (holdings, values, sectors, income events). Full conversation history supported. Returns reply+model+usage. Graceful error for missing ANTHROPIC_API_KEY. Build passes clean. |
| 2026-02-20 | 13.2 | Responsive audit complete. Layout: mobile drawer sidebar (off-screen by default, slide-in on hamburger tap, auto-close on nav), header full-width on mobile. Header: compact currency switcher (symbol-only on xs), portfolio value text scales, notification bell hidden on xs. AI chat: height capped to viewport via min(). CSS: touch-friendly horizontal scroll, smaller chart fonts on mobile. Desktop behavior fully preserved. Build passes clean. |
| 2026-02-20 | MVP COMPLETE | All backlog items done (0.1–13.2). All MVP criteria checked off in MVP.md. Auth, 6 pages, 4 integrations (DeGiro, T212, Binance, Crypto.com), unified portfolio/income, AI chat, currency switcher, responsive layout, caching, error boundaries — all shipped. |
| 2026-02-21 | Broker wiring | Step 0: Broker base URLs moved to env vars (DEGIRO_BASE_URL, T212_BASE_URL, BINANCE_BASE_URL, CRYPTOCOM_BASE_URL) with fallback defaults. All environments configured via vercel env add. |
| 2026-02-21 | Broker wiring | Step 1: DebugPanel + useDebug hook + DebugContext. Floating overlay shows API call logs (provider, action, status, latency, errors). Toggle via bottom-right button. |
| 2026-02-21 | Broker wiring | Step 2: Connection test endpoints added to connections.js for all 4 brokers. GET /api/<provider>/test pings broker API with stored credentials, returns reachable/latency/status. |
| 2026-02-21 | Broker wiring | Step 3: Test Connection button on all 4 broker cards. useTestConnection hook + TestButton component. Results logged to DebugPanel. |
| 2026-02-21 | Broker wiring | Steps 4-9: DeGiro fully wired into unified portfolio. Session (sessionId+intAccount) stored encrypted in connections table after login. fetchDegiroHoldings in portfolio.js with product enrichment. fetchDegiroIncome in income.js with dividend history. Session expiry detection (401/403 marks connection as expired). DegiroContext disconnect calls API. Portfolio/income return useMockData flag for frontend mock fallback. Function count verified: 8/12. Pushed to main, Vercel auto-deploys. |
| 2026-02-24 | Binance client-side | Moved all Binance API calls to browser-side (Web Crypto HMAC-SHA256) to bypass Vercel geo-restriction. Added store-credentials/get-credentials actions to connections.js. Credentials restored on page reload. |
| 2026-02-24 | Connections redesign | Full Connections.jsx rewrite: shared primitives (ModalShell, InputField, SubmitButton, etc.), staggered card-reveal animations, brand accent bars, ~300 lines shorter, JS bundle shrank 20KB. New CSS in index.css. |
